  # Rubin Science Platform APIs

  <Lede>Integrate Rubin data into your analysis tools with APIs.</Lede>

  To access most APIs you need an [*access token*](/auth/tokens).
  See our guide [Creating user tokens](https://rsp.lsst.io/guides/auth/creating-user-tokens.html) to learn more.

  ## Table Access Protocol

  You can access catalog data using the Table Access Protocol (TAP)
  service with popular tools such as
  [TOPCAT](http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat) (GUI) and
  (pyvo)[https://pyvo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html]
  (Python package). The TAP endpoint is:

  ```
  https://data.lsst.cloud/api/tap
  ```

  See our tutorial [Authenticating from TOPCat outside the Science Platform](https://rsp.lsst.io/guides/auth/using-topcat-outside-rsp.html)
  to learn more about accessing TAP datasets from your own computer.

        <Card>
          ### Data Preview 0.2 (DP0.2)

          DP0.2 is the second phase of the Data Preview 0 program using
          precursor data (simulated images from the DESC DC2 data
          challenge). For the first time, all the derived data products
          have been generated "in-house" on an early version of the Rubin
          processing infrastructure using version 23.0 of the LSST Science
          Pipelines. As a result, the data model is significantly
          different from the DP0.1 dataset.

          ### LSST Science Pipelines

          The Science Pipelines include the Butler for accessing LSST data
          and a pipeline framework for processing data. The LSST Science
          Pipelines Python package is preinstalled in the Notebook aspect.
