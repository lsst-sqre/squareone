        ### Data Preview 0.2 (DP0.2)

        DP0.2 is the second phase of the Data Preview 0 program using
        precursor data (simulated images from the DESC DC2 data
        challenge). For the first time, all the derived data products
        have been generated "in-house" on an early version of the Rubin
        processing infrastructure using version 23.0 of the LSST Science
        Pipelines. As a result, the data model is significantly
        different from the DP0.1 dataset.
