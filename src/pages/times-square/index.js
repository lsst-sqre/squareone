      <h1>Easily share Jupyter Notebooks on the Rubin Science Platform</h1>
      <p>
        Times Square lets you view computed Jupyter Notebooks in your browser,
        without spinning up a JupyterLab server. To share a notebook, simply
        copy a URL.
      </p>
      <p>
        All Times Square pages are computed on the Rubin Science Platform. Any
        software (like the LSST Science Pipelines) or data source (such as the
        Butler and EFD) available in interactive JupyterLab sessions are
        available to Times Square notebooks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Times Square is great for sharing engineering and observatory reports,
        dashboards, and analyses.
      </p>

      <h2>Edit on GitHub...</h2>
      <p>
        You can collaboratively maintain collections of notebooks in GitHub
        repositories. When you push to the default branch of a repository where
        the Times Square’s GitHub App is installed, Times Square syncs and
        computes those notebooks on the Rubin Science Platform. Check out{' '}
        <a href="https://github.com/lsst-sqre/times-square-demo">
          lsst-sqre/times-square-demo
        </a>{' '}
        for an example.
      </p>
      <h2>... or upload a notebook directly (coming soon)</h2>
      <p>
        Are you working on a notebook and not ready to commit it to GitHub yet
        (or ever)? You can directly upload a notebook to your personal
        collection of <em>fliers</em>. These are still published and you can
        share links to your fliers. Just keep in mind that any notebook that the
        team relies on and will use in the long term should get moved over to
        GitHub for better collaboration and maintainability.
      </p>
      <h2>Tweak parameters on the fly</h2>
      <p>
        You can use Jinja2 syntax in Markdown and code cells to{' '}
        <em>parameterize</em> Jupyter Notebooks with user inputs.
        Parameterizations are great for changing the date in a nightly report,
        or changing the input dataset for a basic data analysis. You, and other
        users, can change those parameters and see the notebook recomputed
        on-the-fly. Notebook parameterizations are shareable: just copy the URL.
      </p>
      <h2>In beta</h2>
      <p>
        Times Square is currently in beta, meaning that we’re still implementing
        basic features and writing documentation. There’s also a chance that we
        might need to reset databases. You can try Times Square out, but don’t
        rely on it for critical applications just yet.
