Add RadioGroup component with comprehensive accessibility features

Introduces a new RadioGroup component built with Radix UI primitives:

- **Fieldset-based structure** with proper legend and description support
- **Multiple sizing variants** (sm, md, lg) for different use cases
- **Flexible layout options** with horizontal and vertical orientations
- **Individual item descriptions** for additional context
- **Full accessibility compliance** with ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
- **Form integration** works seamlessly with FormField and React Hook Form
- **Disabled state support** for individual options
- **Required field indicators** with proper semantic markup
- **Compound component pattern** (RadioGroup.Item) for clean API

The component supports both controlled and uncontrolled usage patterns, making it suitable for various form implementation approaches across the design system.
