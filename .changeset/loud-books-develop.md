Created GafaelfawrUserMenu based on the Radix UI [navigation-menu](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/navigation-menu) component. That's the right primitive for an accessible menu that uses `<a>` or Next `Link` elements. The existing Gafaelfawr menu is now `GafaelfawrUserDropdown` for reference (it is based on Radix UI's [dropdown menu](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/dropdown-menu), but is more appropriate as a menu of buttons.
