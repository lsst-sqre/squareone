Improve Tabs component contrast in dark mode

Enhanced the visibility of unselected tab labels in dark mode by implementing proper color overrides. Unselected tabs now use light gray text (`--rsd-component-text-reverse-color`) instead of dark gray, significantly improving readability on dark backgrounds. Selected tabs and hover states use lighter teal colors that maintain the visual hierarchy while providing better contrast.
