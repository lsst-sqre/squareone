Migrated Squareone CSS custom properties / design tokens to global-css from the globals.css file in the Squareone app

With this change, any app as well as the Squared component library can use CSS custom properties such as the elevations (box-shadows, e.g. `--sqo-elevation-md`) and transitions (`--sqo-transition-basic`) that are included as global CSS custom properties.
