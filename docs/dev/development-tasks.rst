Development tasks
#################

Once you have a working development environment (see :doc:`set-up`), you can run tasks to help you develop and test applications and packages in the Squareone monorepo.
This page outlines those development tasks.

Start the development server
============================

You can spin up auto-reloading development versions of all the apps at once:

.. code-block:: sh

   pnpm dev

Find the URLs for the apps in the output of the command, or:

- View Squareone at http://localhost:3000.

  `API routes <https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction>`__ are accessed on ``http://localhost:3000/api/*``.
  The ``pages/api`` directory is mapped to ``/api/*``.
  Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.
  The purpose of the ``pages/api/dev`` endpoints are to mock external services in the RSP; see the re-writes in :file:`next.config.js`.

Run a single app in development
-------------------------------

You can run a single app (e.g. Squareone) in development mode:

.. code-block:: sh

   pnpm dev --filter squareone

.. tip::

   Turbo Repo provides a powerful filtering syntax to let you run tasks on a subsets of app and packages, and their dependencies or dependents.
   Learn more in the `Turbo Repo --filter documentation`_.

.. Start the Storybook server
.. ==========================

.. Storybook_ is an environment for documenting and designing React components.
.. .. You can start up Squareone's Storybook development site::

.. .. code-block:: bash

..    pnpm storybook

Manual linting and formatting
-----------------------------

Typically linting is run by your IDE while you develop and again when you commit code (via Husky).
You can also manually lint and format code.

Lint JavaScript (e.g. with `next lint`_ for Next.js apps):

.. code-block:: bash

   pnpm lint

Check formatting with Prettier_:

.. code-block:: bash

   pnpm format:check

Or automatically fix files with Prettier_:

.. code-block:: bash

   pnpm format

Create a production build
=========================

You can create a production build of all applications and packages, which can be a useful check of a process that typically runs inside the Docker image build:

.. code-block:: bash

   pnpm build

To build a specific application and its dependencies, use the ``--filter`` flag:

.. code-block:: bash

   pnpm build --filter squareone

.. tip::

   Learn more about the filtering syntax in the `Turbo Repo --filter documentation`_.

.. TODO: Implement a way to "start" apps with turbo.
.. You can serve the production build locally:

.. .. code-block:: bash

..    npm run serve

VS Code tasks
=============

Many of these tasks are also available as VS Code tasks.
From the VS Code command pallet run ``Tasks: Run Task`` and select the task you want to run.
