## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- [#240](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/pull/240) [`1d8161aa169c159762e28b0e3c1afaea5514ef15`](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/commit/1d8161aa169c159762e28b0e3c1afaea5514ef15) Thanks [@jonathansick](https://github.com/jonathansick)! - Add TAP quota types and improve nullable handling in useGafaelfawrUser

  The `useGafaelfawrUser` hook now includes complete type definitions for all Gafaelfawr quota types, supporting the new quotas page feature:

  **New types added:**

  - `GafaelfawrTapQuota`: Represents TAP service concurrent query limits with a `concurrent` field
  - All quota-related types are now exported: `GafaelfawrQuota`, `GafaelfawrNotebookQuota`, `GafaelfawrApiQuota`, `GafaelfawrTapQuota`, `GafaelfawrGroup`

  **Type improvements:**

  - `GafaelfawrNotebookQuota`: Added `spawn: boolean` field to indicate if notebook spawning is allowed
  - `GafaelfawrQuota`: Added `tap` field for TAP service quotas; made `notebook` explicitly nullable (`| null`)
  - `GafaelfawrUser`: Made `quota` field explicitly nullable (`| null`) to properly handle API responses

  These changes align with the Gafaelfawr API specification and enable proper handling of quota data in the quotas page, including null/empty states for optional quota sections.

- [#240](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/pull/240) [`0e49cf80e8be37ffca6e7897ba07aa91881e7be3`](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/commit/0e49cf80e8be37ffca6e7897ba07aa91881e7be3) Thanks [@jonathansick](https://github.com/jonathansick)! - Add KeyValueList component for displaying key-value data

  The KeyValueList component provides a reusable, accessible way to display key-value pairs using semantic HTML definition lists (`<dl>`, `<dt>`, `<dd>`). This component is designed for the quotas page but can be used throughout the application for displaying structured data.

  Key features:

  - **Semantic HTML**: Uses definition list elements for proper accessibility and screen reader support
  - **Flexible values**: Supports both string and ReactNode values, allowing for badges, links, and formatted content
  - **Responsive layout**: CSS Grid layout with two-column design on desktop, stacking vertically on mobile (â‰¤768px)

- [#228](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/pull/228) [`bf0a8e50a321874abe551ad148255b7546680f31`](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/commit/bf0a8e50a321874abe551ad148255b7546680f31) Thanks [@jonathansick](https://github.com/jonathansick)! - Add Tabs component for tabbed navigation interfaces

  The Tabs component built on Radix UI primitives, providing a fully accessible tabbed interface for organizing content into multiple panels. Key Features:

  - Compound component API (`Tabs.List`, `Tabs.Trigger`, `Tabs.Content`) for flexible composition
  - Full keyboard navigation support (Arrow keys, Home, End)
  - WCAG AAA compliant touch targets (44px minimum)
  - Controlled and uncontrolled modes for state management
  - CSS Modules styling with design tokens from rubin-style-dictionary
  - Comprehensive Storybook documentation with 11 interactive stories and automated tests

### Minor Changes

- [#210](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/pull/210) [`98a4d6560c08a72ba52be6d9e8017e89f7df2cbb`](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/commit/98a4d6560c08a72ba52be6d9e8017e89f7df2cbb) Thanks [@jonathansick](https://github.com/jonathansick)! - Replace tsup build with direct TypeScript transpilation

  Replaced the tsup build tool with direct TypeScript transpilation through the consuming applications. This change:

  - Exports TypeScript source files directly from the package
  - Lets Next.js and other consuming apps handle transpilation
  - Simplifies the build pipeline and removes the build step from the squared package
  - Improves development experience with faster HMR

- [#210](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/pull/210) [`9b6312854eee408a687b8c77978833032773934e`](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/commit/9b6312854eee408a687b8c77978833032773934e) Thanks [@jonathansick](https://github.com/jonathansick)! - Add a new Button component

  This button has flexible styling and utility for a range of applications. It has two main axes of styling via props:

  - `appearance` can be `solid|outline|text`
  - `tone` is `primary|secondary|tertiary|danger` and controls the semantics of the button
  - `role` is a way of quickly setting appearance and tone together for common uses. `role=primary` creates a solid button with primary tone.

  The button also supports icons, loading state, and can be implemented both as a button element or as a link.

- [#213](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/pull/213) [`024b11f8653bb1ade38240f890d8fbbb02aa0841`](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/commit/024b11f8653bb1ade38240f890d8fbbb02aa0841) Thanks [@jonathansick](https://github.com/jonathansick)! - Add Checkbox and CheckboxGroup components with comprehensive accessibility features

  Introduces new form input components that extend the squared design system:

  - **Checkbox**: Accessible checkbox input with multiple size variants (sm, md, lg), disabled states, and error handling. Features WCAG 2.5.5 compliant touch targets with visual appearance that scales independently of the minimum touch area.

  - **CheckboxGroup**: Fieldset-based container for multiple checkboxes with proper legend semantics, orientation options (horizontal/vertical), and FormField integration. Uses the polymorphic Label component for consistent legend styling with support for required indicators and descriptions.

  Both components integrate seamlessly with React Hook Form and provide comprehensive Storybook stories for documentation and testing. The implementation follows the established patterns from RadioGroup and other form components in the library.

- [#216](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/pull/216) [`7238f2ede9e3c1838311bea84d2c3c065be2ad13`](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/commit/7238f2ede9e3c1838311bea84d2c3c065be2ad13) Thanks [@jonathansick](https://github.com/jonathansick)! - Add ClipboardButton component with success feedback

  - Removes the styled-components dependency from the squared package
  - Improves build-time CSS processing
  - Maintains all existing styling and functionality
  - Adds CSS Module type definitions for TypeScript support

- [#219](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/pull/219) [`c85b08254b7bc14688b9f889541962a0a0d511b4`](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/commit/c85b08254b7bc14688b9f889541962a0a0d511b4) Thanks [@jonathansick](https://github.com/jonathansick)! - Add DateTimePicker component with string-based API

  A new comprehensive DateTimePicker component has been added to the squared package, providing:

  **Core Features:**

  - Date and time selection with ISO 8601 datetime-local format
  - Timezone support with conversion between timezones (including 'local' timezone)
  - Calendar picker with custom caption (month/year navigation)
  - Time input with hours/minutes in 24-hour format
  - Timezone selector integrated with the date/time picker
  - Full keyboard accessibility and ARIA support
  - CSS Modules styling with design tokens
  - Comprehensive test coverage (unit and Storybook tests)
  - Built on react-day-picker for calendar functionality
  - Fixed popover auto-closing issue when clicking inside the picker for better UX in filter contexts

  **API Design:**

  - **String-based API**: Uses ISO 8601 strings for dates (`defaultValue` prop)
  - **Uncontrolled pattern**: Component manages its own state internally
  - **Simple onChange signature**: `(isoString: string) => void` - returns ISO 8601 timestamp only
  - **Explicit timezone control**: `defaultTimezone` prop for initial timezone (default: 'local')
  - **Optional seconds support**: `showSeconds` prop for precise timestamps
  - **Force updates**: Use `key` prop to reset component with new values

  **Exports:**

  - `DateTimePicker` component
  - Utility functions for date/time manipulation (`dateUtils.ts`)
  - Timezone handling utilities (`timezoneUtils.ts`)

  **Usage Example:**

  ```tsx
  <DateTimePicker
    defaultValue="2024-01-15T14:30:00Z"
    defaultTimezone="UTC"
    onChange={(isoString) => console.log(isoString)}
  />
  ```

  The string-based API provides better interoperability with REST APIs and simplifies common usage patterns by eliminating the need for Date object conversion.

  The TextInput component now supports a `trailingAction` prop for adding interactive elements (like buttons) at the end of the input field. This is distinct from `trailingIcon` which is for non-interactive visual elements.

  - `trailingAction` and `trailingIcon` are mutually exclusive
  - When `trailingAction` is provided, it takes precedence
  - Proper styling and spacing for action elements
  - Used by DateTimePicker for calendar toggle button

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#179](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/pull/179) [`b4b2fdb`](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/commit/b4b2fdb72ea42adf3142ee53bdb463e9bfebe441) Thanks [@jonathansick](https://github.com/jonathansick)! - Moved auth URLs into Squared as a library. The `getLoginUrl` and `getLogout` URL functions compute the full URLs to the RSP's login and logout endpoints and include the `?rd` query strings to return the user to current and home URL respectively.

- [#179](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/pull/179) [`77274e7`](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/commit/77274e7a144158ac267f4b38a1e7dc48cb10f2de) Thanks [@jonathansick](https://github.com/jonathansick)! - Add a new PrimaryNavigation component. This component uses the Radix [NavigationMenu](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/navigation-menu) primitive and is intended to be a comprehensive solution for the primary navigation in the header of Squareone. The earlier `GafaelfawrUserMenu` component in Squared also uses `NavigationMenu`, but as a single item. With `PrimaryNavigation`, the functionality of `GafaelfawrUserMenu` can be composed into an instance of `PrimaryNavigation`. Like `GafaelfawrMenu`, `PrimaryNavigation` is set up so that menus only appear after clicking on a trigger, rather than on hover. As well, `PrimaryNavigation` ensures the menu is proximate to the trigger (an improvement on the default `NavigationMenu` functionality that centers the menu below the whole navigation element.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#173](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/pull/173) [`c5dac7f`](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/commit/c5dac7ff7b8846e665918b32a7fdac8193615dfd) Thanks [@jonathansick](https://github.com/jonathansick)! - Added a new component, `IconPill`. This component creates an inline pill that acts as a link button. The contents of the pill are an easy-to-configure icon from FontAwesome alongside text. The colours of the pill are configurable by props, but by default the pill looks similar to to the button component.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#166](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/pull/166) [`157d03d`](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/commit/157d03db4fe3e559dc0071c1a1567200d376e1be) Thanks [@jonathansick](https://github.com/jonathansick)! - Created GafaelfawrUserMenu based on the Radix UI [navigation-menu](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/navigation-menu) component. That's the right primitive for an accessible menu that uses `<a>` or Next `Link` elements. The existing Gafaelfawr menu is now `GafaelfawrUserDropdown` for reference (it is based on Radix UI's [dropdown menu](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/dropdown-menu), but is more appropriate as a menu of buttons.

- [#168](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/pull/168) [`f403ffd`](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/commit/f403ffd461983a579614d1ae4aa2c4b42537c294) Thanks [@jonathansick](https://github.com/jonathansick)! - Disable opening and closing the GafaelfawrUserMenu on hover. This is a better UX because it allows for less precise mousing when using the menu.

### Minor Changes

- [#155](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/pull/155) [`b765732`](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/commit/b765732db52e354026294fce7b5ef7c32d32e553) Thanks [@jonathansick](https://github.com/jonathansick)! - Add a useGafaelfawrUser hook.

- [#153](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/pull/153) [`9abbebb`](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/commit/9abbebba02fc1bc27fe2097fbbdb97110a9c93d9) Thanks [@jonathansick](https://github.com/jonathansick)! - This is the first release of the Squared React component library for Squareone.

- [#155](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/pull/155) [`30928a5`](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/commit/30928a5caa5392d7927fd3a2f017d48d77b68c1a) Thanks [@jonathansick](https://github.com/jonathansick)! - Add a GafaelfawrUserMenu component to squared. This is based on the Radix UI dropdown menu and implements a login button if the user is not authenticated or a full user settings menu if the user is authenticated. A logout menu item is always included at the end of the menu, but apps can compose other user menu items in the component. As the name implies, this component is tied into the logic and usage patterns of Gafaelfawr as an auth service.

This works with `react/router` and a provided base URL to get the absolute URL of the current page view. Next.js is now a peer dependency of squared to support this.
