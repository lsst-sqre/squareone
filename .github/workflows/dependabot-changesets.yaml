name: Add Changesets to Dependabot PRs

# Security Design:
# - Uses `pull_request` trigger (not `pull_request_target`) to avoid "pwn request"
#   vulnerability where untrusted code executes with write permissions
# - Verifies PR author using `github.event.pull_request.user.login` instead of
#   `github.actor` to prevent "Confused Deputy" attacks where attackers
#   manipulate Dependabot to trigger malicious actions
# - Safe for Dependabot PRs because Dependabot creates branches in the same
#   repository (not forks), so `pull_request` trigger has necessary permissions
# - This pattern is recommended by GitHub's official Dependabot documentation
